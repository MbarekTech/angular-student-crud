# Screenshots

Please add a screenshot of your application here. You can:

1. Take a screenshot of the running application
2. Save it as `screenshot.png` in the root directory
3. The README already references it

## Recommended screenshots:
- Main student list view with some data
- Add/edit student form
- Search functionality in action

## How to take a good screenshot:
- Make sure you have some sample data
- Show the responsive design (maybe a mobile view too)
- Capture the clean Bootstrap styling
- Include the search bar with some text

The screenshot should showcase:
✓ Clean, professional UI
✓ Bootstrap styling
✓ Student data in the table
✓ Search functionality
✓ Action buttons (Edit, Delete)
